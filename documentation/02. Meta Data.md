# Meta Data

Only at the begining of the file. Meta data definition starts with `---` on the **first line of the document**. Then one meta data definition per line until the end of meta data definition with `---`.

Any spaces around `<Content>` are trimmed.

## Syntax Definition

```dsbp
---
<Type>: <Content>
---
```

Key meta data types are
- `Blueprint`* - Version of the used blueprint formatting
- `Project` - Version of the working project
- `Document` - Version of the working document
- `LastUpdate` - Date and time of the last document update

The `Document` and the `LastUpdate` fields should update on every change.

## Example

This defines version of the documents blueprint.

```dsbp
---
Blueprint: v1.0.5
Project: v1.0
Document: v1.0.1
LastUpdate: 2018-05-26 23:43:12
---
```

## Dynamic Meta Data

Meta data can be used as a variable. When parsing the document, the meta data variable will automatically apply as a string.

```dsbp
---
Blueprint: v1.0.5
Project: v1.0
Document: ${Project}.1
---
```

If the it's not defined, it will not be parsed as a variable but as plain text.
