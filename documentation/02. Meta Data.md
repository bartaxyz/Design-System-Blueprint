```

## Syntax Definition

Meta data definition starts with `---` on the **first line of the document** and ends with `---`. Content inside strictly follows YAML syntax.

Required meta data:
- `Blueprint` - Version of the used blueprint formatting

Optional defined meta data:
- `Project` - Version of the working project
- `Document` - Version of the working document
- `LastUpdate` - Date and time of the last document update

The `Document` and the `LastUpdate` fields should update on every change.

Other properties can be added as long as they follow the YAML syntax.
